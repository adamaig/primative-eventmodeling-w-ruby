adamaig: What interface methods should be part of an eventstore

GitHub Copilot: Looking at your event modeling spec and thinking about event store patterns, here are the core interface methods that should be part of an event store:

## Core EventStore Interface Methods

### 1. **Event Persistence**
- `append_event(stream_id, event)` or `append_events(stream_id, events)` - Add new events to a stream
- `commit` - Persist pending events (if using transactions)

### 2. **Event Retrieval**
- `get_events(stream_id, from_version = 0)` - Get all events for a specific stream
- `get_events_from_version(stream_id, version)` - Get events from a specific version
- `get_all_events(from_position = 0)` - Get all events across all streams

### 3. **Stream Management**
- `stream_exists?(stream_id)` - Check if a stream exists
- `get_stream_version(stream_id)` - Get the current version of a stream
- `delete_stream(stream_id)` - Mark a stream as deleted

### 4. **Concurrency Control**
- `append_event_with_expected_version(stream_id, event, expected_version)` - Optimistic concurrency control
- `get_stream_metadata(stream_id)` - Get stream metadata including version

### 5. **Querying & Projections**
- `get_events_by_type(event_type)` - Filter events by type
- `get_events_in_range(from_timestamp, to_timestamp)` - Time-based queries
- `subscribe_to_stream(stream_id, callback)` - Real-time subscriptions

### 6. **Snapshots (Optional)**
- `save_snapshot(stream_id, version, snapshot_data)` - Store aggregate snapshots
- `get_snapshot(stream_id)` - Retrieve latest snapshot

Based on your current spec, you might want to expand your `EventStore` class to include these methods. The `events` method you're testing could be part of a broader interface like `get_all_events`.

Would you like me to help implement any of these methods in your `EventModeling::EventStore` class?

adamaig: Add pending specs for each of the methods

GitHub Copilot: I'll add pending specs for each of the core EventStore interface methods. Let me expand your spec file: 
```


Made changes.


```
I've added pending specs for all the core EventStore interface methods. The specs are organized into logical groups:

1. **Event Persistence** - Methods for adding events
2. **Event Retrieval** - Methods for reading events
3. **Stream Management** - Methods for managing streams
4. **Concurrency Control** - Methods for handling concurrent access
5. **Querying & Projections** - Methods for filtering and subscribing
6. **Snapshots** - Optional methods for performance optimization

Each pending spec includes a descriptive name that explains what the method should do. You can now run the specs to see all the pending tests, and then implement them one by one as you build out your EventStore class.

The specs also include some shared `let` blocks for common test data like `stream_id` and `event` that can be reused across multiple tests.

adamaig: complete the specs for append_event and append_events

GitHub Copilot: I'll complete the specs for `append_event` and `append_events` methods. Let me implement comprehensive tests for these core event persistence methods: 
```


Made changes.


```
I've completed comprehensive specs for the `append_event` and `append_events` methods. The specs cover:

## `append_event` specs:
- **Basic functionality** - Appending a single event and verifying it's stored
- **Multiple events** - Appending events one by one to the same stream
- **Version numbering** - Ensuring events get sequential version numbers
- **Timestamps** - Verifying events are timestamped
- **Stream isolation** - Ensuring events in different streams don't interfere

## `append_events` specs:
- **Batch operations** - Appending multiple events in one operation
- **Sequential versioning** - Version numbers continue sequentially in batches
- **Version continuation** - Versions continue from existing events in the stream
- **Empty arrays** - Handling edge case of empty event arrays
- **Order preservation** - Ensuring events maintain their order within a batch

These specs assume the EventStore will:
- Add metadata like `version` and `timestamp` to events
- Maintain separate event streams by `stream_id`
- Provide a `get_events(stream_id)` method to retrieve stored events

The specs use RSpec matchers like `have(n).items` and test both the happy path and edge cases. You can now implement the EventStore class to make these specs pass!
