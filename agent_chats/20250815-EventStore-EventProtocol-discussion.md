# 20250815-EventStore-EventProtocol-discussion.md

**Date:** August 15, 2025  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (GPT-4.1)  
**Session Theme:** EventStore interface documentation and EventProtocol extraction

---

## Summary Section

**Key Insights:**
- The EventStore implementation was extracted to `simple_event_modeling/common` and namespaced for clarity.
- Discussion clarified why a minimal event class is used in specs: to isolate EventStore logic and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
- It was recommended to document the expected event interface for EventStore, leading to the creation of an `EventProtocol` module.
- YARD documentation was added to EventStore referencing the protocol, improving maintainability and onboarding for future contributors.
- The spec was updated with a comment clarifying the minimal event class implements the protocol.
- Best practices for `require`, `require_relative`, and `autoload` were discussed, with recommendations for placement and usage.
- Potential problems with `autoload` were outlined, including thread safety and circular dependencies.

**Implementation Decisions:**
- Use block style for nested module declarations for clarity and maintainability.
- Place `require`/`require_relative` at the top of files, outside module blocks; remove useage of `autoload`, preferring explicit requires.
- Document protocol requirements in both implementation and specs.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue documenting interfaces for other components as needed.
- Consider adding runtime checks or type assertions for protocol compliance if strictness is desired.

## Full Conversation

**User:**
Copy the EventStore implementation and spec into appropriate files under the simple_event_modeling/common folder and update the namespace to match the new location. Add the appropriate require to the simple_event_modeling/common module (See <attachments> above for file contents. You may not need to search or read the file again.)

**User:**
why did you create a local event_class in the spec instead of using the Event class in the module?

**Copilot:**
I created a local event_class in the spec to avoid dependencies on the full Event class implementation, which includes additional fields and logic (like id, created_at, data, etc.) that are not strictly required for testing the basic behavior of EventStore. This keeps the spec focused on stream and version management, and makes it easier to isolate and test the EventStore logic without needing to construct full domain events.

**User:**
I like the reasoning you explained. is there anything that should be added to the module to help make the actual dependency clearer?

**Copilot:**
To make the actual dependency clearer in the module, you could:
- Add YARD documentation to EventStore specifying that it expects event objects to respond to aggregate_id and version.
- Optionally, define a minimal interface or protocol (e.g., a comment or a Ruby module) that describes the required event attributes.
- Add a type check or validation in the append method to ensure the event responds to the necessary methods.

**User:**
Add both documenation and show me what the protocol module would look like

**User:**
The spec event_class doesn't mention this protocol. should that be documented?

**Copilot:**
Yes, it should be documented in the spec. Adding a comment or YARD doc to the spec’s event_class clarifies that it is a minimal implementation of the required protocol for EventStore. This helps future readers understand why the local class is sufficient and what interface it is expected to provide.

**User:**
just add the minimal inline comment to the event_class, and then make all the discussed edits
