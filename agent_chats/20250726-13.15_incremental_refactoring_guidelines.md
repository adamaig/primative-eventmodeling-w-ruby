# 20250726-13.15 - Incremental Refactoring Guidelines
**Date:** July 26, 2025 13:15  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (GPT-4)  
**Session Theme:** Establishing Incremental Refactoring Guidelines

## Summary

After completing Phase 1 in a single large step, we identified the need for smaller, more focused refactoring steps. This document establishes guidelines for incremental development that ensures each commit contains exactly one conceptual change.

### Key Issues Identified
- **Too Many Changes at Once**: Phase 1 included directory creation, file extraction, new class creation, and spec writing all in one step
- **Large Commit Surface**: Hard to review and understand what changed
- **Risk of Merge Conflicts**: Large changes increase chance of conflicts
- **Debugging Difficulty**: If something breaks, hard to isolate the cause

### New Approach
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit changes exactly one thing
- **Test-Driven Steps**: Write tests first, then make them pass
- **Validation Points**: Run full test suite after each step
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined start and end points for each change

## Revised Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1A: Create Directory Structure Only
**Goal**: Set up the directory structure without any code changes
**Steps**:
1. Create `lib/event_modeling/` directory
2. Verify structure exists
3. Run tests to ensure nothing broken
**Commit**: "Create modular directory structure"

### Phase 1B: Extract Version File
**Goal**: Move version constant to separate file with tests
**Steps**:
1. Create `lib/event_modeling/version.rb` with VERSION constant
2. Create `spec/event_modeling/version_spec.rb` with comprehensive tests
3. Update main file to require version file
4. Run tests to verify everything works
**Commit**: "Extract version to separate file"

### Phase 1C: Extract Error Hierarchy
**Goal**: Move all error classes to separate file with tests
**Steps**:
1. Create `lib/event_modeling/errors.rb` with all error classes
2. Create `spec/event_modeling/errors_spec.rb` with comprehensive tests
3. Update main file to require errors file
4. Remove error definitions from main file
5. Run tests to verify everything works
**Commit**: "Extract error hierarchy to separate file"

### Phase 1D: Create Event Class
**Goal**: Add new Event class without changing existing functionality
**Steps**:
1. Create `lib/event_modeling/event.rb` with full Event class
2. Create `spec/event_modeling/event_spec.rb` with comprehensive tests
3. Update main file to require event file
4. Run tests to verify everything works
**Commit**: "Add Event class for better encapsulation"

### Phase 1E: Extract EventStore Class
**Goal**: Move EventStore to separate file and enhance initialization
**Steps**:
1. Create `lib/event_modeling/event_store.rb` with EventStore class
2. Update EventStore constructor to initialize all instance variables
3. Create `spec/event_modeling/event_store_spec.rb` for enhanced initialization
4. Update main file to require event_store file
5. Remove EventStore from main file
6. Run tests to verify everything works
**Commit**: "Extract EventStore to separate file with enhanced initialization"

### Phase 1F: Add Module Convenience Methods
**Goal**: Add factory methods to main module
**Steps**:
1. Add `new_event_store` and `new_event` methods to main module
2. Create `spec/event_modeling/module_spec.rb` for integration tests
3. Run tests to verify everything works
**Commit**: "Add convenience factory methods to main module"

## Benefits of Incremental Approach

### 1. **Easier Review and Understanding**
- Each commit has a clear, single purpose
- Changes are small and focused
- Easy to understand what changed and why

### 2. **Better Debugging**
- If something breaks, easy to identify which change caused it
- Can revert specific changes without losing other work
- Clear history of what was working at each step

### 3. **Reduced Risk**
- Smaller changes are less likely to introduce bugs
- Can catch issues early before they compound
- Each step is fully validated before proceeding

### 4. **Better Collaboration**
- Easier for multiple developers to work on same codebase
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clear progress tracking

### 5. **Professional Development Practices**
- Follows industry best practices for software development
- Makes code reviews more effective
- Demonstrates good software engineering discipline

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Phase
1. **Plan the Steps**: Write down exactly what will change
2. **Define Success Criteria**: How will you know the step is complete?
3. **Identify Validation Points**: When will you run tests?
4. **Prepare Rollback Plan**: How to undo changes if needed?

### During Each Step
1. **Make Minimal Changes**: Only change what's necessary for this step
2. **Test Frequently**: Run tests after each logical change
3. **Document Progress**: Update chat logs with what's happening
4. **Stop on Red Tests**: If tests fail, fix before proceeding

### After Each Step
1. **Run Full Test Suite**: Ensure everything still works
2. **Review Changes**: Check that only expected changes were made
3. **Create Descriptive Commit**: Clear message about what changed
4. **Update Documentation**: Reflect changes in relevant docs

## Agent Guidelines

### Session Management
- **One Step Per Session**: Focus on exactly one atomic change
- **Clear Session Goals**: Start each session with specific objective
- **Validation Checkpoints**: Always end with passing tests
- **Progress Documentation**: Record what was accomplished

### Communication Pattern
- **Propose Before Executing**: Describe the step before taking action
- **Ask for Confirmation**: Get user approval for the approach
- **Report Progress**: Keep user informed of status
- **Highlight Issues**: Flag any problems immediately

### Error Handling
- **Stop on Failures**: Don't proceed if tests fail
- **Investigate Issues**: Understand root cause before fixing
- **Ask for Help**: Involve user if stuck or unsure
- **Document Solutions**: Record how issues were resolved

This incremental approach ensures higher quality, lower risk, and better maintainability throughout the refactoring process.

## Full Conversation

**User:** There were too many steps executed. I want smaller refactoring steps that separate each commit into a single conceptual change. How should we modify the instruction files to achieve that?
