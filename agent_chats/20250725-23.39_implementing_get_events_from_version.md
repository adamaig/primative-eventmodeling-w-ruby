# Implementing get_events_from_version Method - Chat Session

**Date**: July 25, 2025 - 15:05 UTC  
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot (GPT-4)  
**Theme**: Implementing EventStore get_events_from_version with BDD cycle

## Summary

### BDD Cycle Completion
- **RED**: ✅ Wrote 5 comprehensive failing specs covering core functionality and edge cases
- **GREEN**: ✅ Implemented minimal working solution that passes all specs
- **REFACTOR**: ✅ Implementation was already clean, no refactoring needed

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Parameter Handling**: Version parameter of 0 or 1 returns all events (common event sourcing pattern)
- **Non-existent Streams**: Returns empty array rather than raising errors (graceful degradation)
- **Version Filtering**: Uses `select` with version comparison for clean, readable filtering
- **Data Structure**: Leverages existing `@streams` Hash structure efficiently

### Testing Strategy
- **Core Functionality**: Tests filtering from specific version onwards
- **Boundary Conditions**: Tests version 0, 1, and higher than stream length
- **Edge Cases**: Non-existent streams, empty results
- **Version Verification**: Confirms returned events have correct version numbers
- **Order Preservation**: Ensures events maintain their original order

### Implementation Details
```ruby
def get_events_from_version(stream_id, version)
  stream_events = @streams[stream_id] || []
  return stream_events if version <= 1
  
  stream_events.select { |event| event[:version] >= version }
end
```

### Next Steps
- Implement `get_all_events` method (depends on this method for some functionality)
- Continue with Phase 1 methods: foundation event retrieval capabilities
- Maintain test coverage and documentation quality

### Implementation Request
**User**: begin executing the plan

**GitHub Copilot**: I'll begin executing the plan by implementing the first method: `get_events_from_version`. Following the BDD red-green-refactor cycle, I'll start with the RED phase by writing comprehensive failing specs.

### RED Phase - Writing Failing Specs
**Implementation**: Added 5 comprehensive specs to replace the single pending spec:

1. **Core Functionality**: `gets events from a specific version onwards`
   - Sets up 3 events with versions 1, 2, 3
   - Requests events from version 2 onwards
   - Expects events 2 and 3 with correct types and versions

2. **Boundary Case**: `returns all events when version is 1`
   - Tests that version 1 returns complete stream
   - Verifies all events are returned in order

3. **Edge Case**: `returns empty array when version is higher than stream`
   - Tests requesting version 5 when only 1 event exists
   - Expects graceful empty array response

4. **Error Case**: `returns empty array for non-existent stream`
   - Tests behavior with non-existent stream ID
   - Expects empty array rather than error

5. **Special Case**: `returns all events when version is 0`
   - Tests version 0 edge case (common in event sourcing)
   - Expects same behavior as version 1

**Test Results**: All 5 specs failed with `NoMethodError` as expected - RED phase complete.

### GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation
**Implementation**: Added minimal working method:
```ruby
def get_events_from_version(stream_id, version)
  stream_events = @streams[stream_id] || []
  return stream_events if version <= 1
  
  stream_events.select { |event| event[:version] >= version }
end
```

**Key Implementation Decisions**:
- Handle non-existent streams gracefully with `|| []`
- Treat version 0 and 1 as "from beginning" (event sourcing convention)
- Use `select` with version comparison for filtering
- Maintain event order from original stream

**Test Results**: All 5 specs passed - GREEN phase complete.

### REFACTOR Phase - Code Cleanup
**Analysis**: The implementation was already clean and followed Ruby conventions:
- Clear variable names (`stream_events`)
- Appropriate use of guard clause for early return
- Efficient filtering with `select`
- Proper handling of edge cases

**Decision**: No refactoring needed - implementation is production-ready.

**Final Test Results**: All 5 specs continue to pass.

### Implementation Verification
The method successfully implements the EventStore interface requirement for version-based event retrieval:

1. **Functional Requirements**: ✅ Returns events from specified version onwards
2. **Performance**: ✅ Efficient O(n) filtering operation
3. **Error Handling**: ✅ Graceful handling of edge cases
4. **Integration**: ✅ Works with existing `@streams` data structure
5. **Testing**: ✅ Comprehensive spec coverage with 100% pass rate

### Architecture Integration
This method integrates seamlessly with the existing EventStore architecture:
- **Data Structure**: Uses established `@streams` Hash pattern
- **Event Format**: Compatible with enhanced events (type, data, version, timestamp)
- **Stream Isolation**: Maintains independent stream versioning
- **Memory Efficiency**: No data duplication, references existing events

The implementation follows the copilot instructions for in-memory persistence and maintains compatibility with the append_event methods previously implemented.
