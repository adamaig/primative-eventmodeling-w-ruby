# Represents a change in state of the generating Aggregate.
#
# When something important has occurred within the aggregate, it will raise an event...When an event is raised by an aggregate, it is wrapped in a DomainEventMessage (which extends EventMessage).
# Although domain events technically indicate a state change, you should try to capture the intention of the state in the event, too. A good practice is to use an abstract implementation of a domain event to capture the fact that certain state has changed, and use a concrete sub-implementation of that abstract class that indicates the intention of the change. For example, you could have an abstract AddressChangedEvent, and two implementations ContactMovedEvent and AddressCorrectedEvent that capture the intent of the state change.
